# AutoSpectre

This library contains the `AutoSpectreFormAttribute` for decorating a class and `TextPromptAttribute`,`SelectPromptAttribute` for decorating properties and `TaskStepAttribute` for methods. 
It does not do much by itself. It should be installed through the nuget package `AutoSpectre.SourceGeneration` which will generate code for prompting for data using data from the attributes.
